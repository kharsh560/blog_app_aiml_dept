Steps to setup this app in your PC:-

S1) First of all make a fork of this repo for yourself. Means, do not start direct contribution.

S2) Then, clone your fork to your system.

S3) Open it in VS Code

S4) Right click on the "blog_app_frontend" folder, and choose "open in integrated terminal"

S5) Now, go to that terminal. Also cross check that its the terminal of "blog_app_frontend" folder only by having a look at the path.

S6) Run this command "npm i" to install the node modules folder (its a heavy folder and hence is not uploaded to github, always is done like this only.)

S7) After this, just run "npm run start" {As of now the backend is not setup, so no tension of it!}

Now, smash your keyboards and rock on!
